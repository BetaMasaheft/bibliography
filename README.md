Bibliography workflow and tools for HLCEES

This repository contains the development CSL styles of the Hiob Ludolf Center for Ethiopian and Eritrean Studies.
- the main style is [hiob-ludolf-center-for-ethiopian-studies](hiob-ludolf-center-for-ethiopian-studies.csl)

From this style the following variant are derived
- [a variant including URLs and DOIs](hiob-ludolf-centre-for-ethiopian-studies-with-url-doi.csl)
- [a variant with full names](hiob-ludolf-centre-for-ethiopian-studies-long-names.csl)
- [a variant without distinctions of citation format](hiob-ludolf-centre-for-ethiopian-studies-fullcit.csl) the effect of this is that all entries, including encyclopaedia entries use author date and are disambiguated accordingly in the bibliography.
- [a variant combining the features of the previous two](hiob-ludolf-centre-for-ethiopian-studies-long-names-fullcit.csl)
